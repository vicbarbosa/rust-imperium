Imperium creates a unique new way to play Rust, first used on servers such as Rust Factions and The Lost Isles. Claim land, fight wars, and battle for supremacy!

At its heart, Imperium adds the idea of "territory" to Rust. The game is divided into a grid of tiles matching those displayed on the in-game map. Players can create factions, and these factions can claim these tiles of land and levy taxes on resources harvested therein. Factions can declare war on one another and battle for control of the territory.

To allow you to restrict PVP only to certain areas, Imperium can also add zones around monuments and events like airdrops and heli crashes. These appear in-game as domes over the areas, and you can choose to block PVP damage outside of these domes.

Imperium is extremely configurable, leading to a wide range of game modes. Here are some ideas!

* Create a RP/PVE server where players can claim land to avoid being raided, and PVP is restricted to monuments and events.
* Create a server similar to PVE-Conflict in Conan Exiles, where player structures can't be raided but PVP is allowed everywhere.
* Create a more traditional PVP server, but factions can claim land and have to declare war on one another in order to raid.
